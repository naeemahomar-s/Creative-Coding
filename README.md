# Creative-Coding
This project is about political news on social media.
I counted how many times I saw politics each day.
I tracked this from October 12th

The data came from apps I use every day.
These include Instagram, TikTok, Twitter/X, Snapchat, and YouTube.
Some days I saw nothing.
Other days I saw a lot.

I made a line graph using Processing.
The x-axis shows the days.
The y-axis shows the number of times I saw politics.
High points mean I saw more politics on that day.

Most days were low.
I often saw 0, 1, or 2 times.
There were some spikes.
On those days I saw 7, 8, or even 10 times.
These days usually feet busy.
There was lots of news and trending events.

To view the graph, open the code in Processing.
Then click Run.
